# Portfolio
My portfolio - includes sample projects I wrote from scratch that demonstrate proficiency with various programming concepts. Download each .h file with its accompanying .cpp demo file

Current projects include:
1. A singly-linked list with a number of member functions (LinkedList.h and LLLibrary.cpp)
2. A collection of header files demonstrating principles of object-oriented programming and class inheritance, along with a .cpp demonstrator
(Student.h, Freshman.h, Sophomore.h, Junior.h, Senior.h, Staff.h, Instructor.h, Administrator.h)
